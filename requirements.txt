# 视频评估工具包依赖 (VBench集成版本)
# Video Evaluation Toolkit Dependencies (VBench Integrated)

# Core ML/DL frameworks
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Computer vision and image processing
opencv-python>=4.5.0
scikit-image>=0.19.0

# Audio processing (for LSE calculator)
librosa>=0.9.0
python_speech_features>=0.6.0

# Video processing
ffmpeg-python>=0.2.0
scenedetect>=0.6.0

# Image quality metrics
lpips>=0.1.4

# CLIP for similarity calculation
git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git

# FVD calculation dependencies
# Note: I3D features extracted using torchvision r3d models or custom implementation

# VBench video generation quality assessment
# Note: VBench should be installed separately in appropriate environment
# conda activate vbench (recommended)
# or pip install vbench

# Math and scientific computing
scipy>=1.8.0

# Utilities
tqdm>=4.62.0
Pillow>=8.3.0

# Data handling
PyYAML>=6.0

# Advanced face detection (optional, recommended for better performance)
# Install ONE of the following for improved face detection:

# Option 1: MediaPipe (recommended - fast, accurate, lightweight)
# mediapipe>=0.10.0

# Option 2: YOLOv8 for face detection (very fast, good accuracy)
# ultralytics>=8.0.0

# Option 3: RetinaFace (highest accuracy, slower)
# retinaface>=0.0.12

# Traditional fallback: OpenCV Haar cascade (already included in opencv-python)

# Optional: for improved performance
# numba>=0.56.0

# Note for VBench users:
# If you already have a VBench conda environment, activate it and run:
# pip install lpips python_speech_features scenedetect mediapipe git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
# 
# For new installation, use:
# conda env create -f environment.yaml
#
# Advanced metrics installation:
# - CLIP similarity: Included above with CLIP installation
# - FVD calculation: Uses torchvision (included with torch)
# - GIM matching: Uses custom implementation (no additional dependencies)
#
# Full installation for all features:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# pip install mediapipe  # For improved face detection
